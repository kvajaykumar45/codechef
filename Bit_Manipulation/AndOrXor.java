Problem: And, OR, XOR

Binary Number
In our day-to-day life, we use decimal numbers. Decimal numbers are made up of 10 different digits. Binary numbers are made up of only two digits: 0 and 1. We can represent any decimal number as a binary number. For example, 1 is 1, 2 is 10, 3 is 11.

Bit manipulation
Bit manipulation involves manipulating individual bits within a binary representation of the data. This can be useful in various programming tasks, such as optimizing code and implementing certain algorithms.
We use bitwise operators like AND, OR, and XOR to perform these operations.
    • Bitwise AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is 1 only if both bits are 1. 
           Example :   5 & 3 = 1  (Decimal representation)

    • Bitwise OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is 1 if at least one of the bits is 1. 
           Example :   5 | 3 = 7  (Decimal representation)
                  
    • Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is 1 if the bits are different. 
           Example :   5 ^ 3 = 6  (Decimal representation)
                   
Truth Table for the above operations.
| 3 | 5 | 3 AND 5 | 3 OR 5 | 3 XOR 5 |
|---|---|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 1 |    1    |   1    |    0    |
| 1 | 0 |    0    |   1    |    1    |
| 0 | 1 |    0    |   1    |    1    |
| 0 | 0 |    0    |   0    |    0    |

Task
    • Perform the following operations (((3&5)|4)^7) and print the correct output.
